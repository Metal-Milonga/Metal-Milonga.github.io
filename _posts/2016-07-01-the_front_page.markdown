I liked the early days of the World Wide Web. The days before you were allowed to sell anything online.  I liked the look of it visually.  Maybe that is because I am getting older, because I find myself also liking very old movies too.  i never really liked old movies except Abbott & Costello films.

Last night, I watched a movie called **The Front Page**. (Produced by Howard Hughes)

In the early days of movies they always opened with the credits, and in this film the credits were displayed as the pages of a newspaper.  The front page had the title, and they turned the page for you to reveal more credits.

The later pages had the visual part of the page dedicated to each actor in the movie.  One of the main reasons I watched the movie in the first place was because it stared Adolphe Menjou.  I had always wondered about this actor, because the `M*A*S*H` character, Hawkeye, mentions him once or twice in the series.  The reference is to an actor who is very well dressed.  So, I wanted to see this person, and thanks to TCM, I could.

As I watched the credits, the whole layout started to look beautiful to me, as I related how HTML & CSS help us to layout a web page.  Mentally, I was comparing what we do today to create engaging, informative websites, and what the printers and layout people had to do to create readable newspapers.

It all reminded me about when I first started learning HTML; all we did was just concentrated on nice layout of text and a picture or two.  Now we have amazing control over what happens on a web page, and sometimes it truely amazes me.
